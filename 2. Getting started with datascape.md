What is a datascape :
- 3D objects and models
	- primitives geometries
- data in csv format
- images textures

- tags files

Minimum viable datascape: a node file is all it takes to display 

# Designing a datascape : workflow per user type
1- ideas, mock-up and asset collection
2- assets wrangling and iteration
3- clean-up, bundle and share

A datascape is a folder on your local file system where GaiaViz stores your data.
The most elementary form is a node.csv file, and the most complex datascapes includes images, tags files, 3D models, plugins, animation track.

You can keep all your datascapes in one place, or create several folders for each of your different projects.


- Create a manual datascape: 
	Open GaiaViz app and start create one in app

- Open existing datascape: If you have a datascape that you wish to open:
	1. Open GaiaViz and hit the "L" keyboard key to open the Load Dialog
	2. Navigate to your datascape location and select the .bat file
Saving a datascape from the app will generate a .bat file.
To import a datascape, hit the "L" key, navigate the file dialog to the 

- Create a datascape programmatically





# Advanced datascapes: Python
- tracks and channels

## Automatically with data tools
