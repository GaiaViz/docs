# Datascape components and complexity

- basic 
- advanced

What is a datascape :
- 3D objects and models
	- primitives geometries
- data in csv format
- images textures

- tags files

Minimum viable datascape: a node file is all it takes to display 

# Designing a datascape : workflow per user type
1- ideas, mock-up and asset collection
2- assets wrangling and iteration
3- clean-up, bundle and share

## Data analysts

## Graphic and motion designer
## Programmers

# Basic datascapes editing : "WYSIWYG"

- direct creation of your datascape allow to 
- geometry, colors

## Manually create from the interface


A datascape is a folder on your local file system where GaiaViz stores your data.
The most elementary form is a node.csv file, and the most complex datascapes includes images, tags files, 3D models, plugins, animation track.

You can keep all your datascapes in one place, or create several folders for each of your different projects.


- Create a manual datascape: 
	Open GaiaViz app and start create one in app

- Open existing datascape: If you have a datascape that you wish to open:
	1. Open GaiaViz and hit the "L" keyboard key to open the Load Dialog
	2. Navigate to your datascape location and select the .bat file
Saving a datascape from the app will generate a .bat file.
To import a datascape, hit the "L" key, navigate the file dialog to the 

- Create a datascape programmatically





# Advanced datascapes: Python
- tracks and channels

## Automatically with data tools



# Manage datascapes

# Supported file formats

GaiaViz will load the following formats:
- Image files: `tiff`,`jpg`,`png`
- 3D models files: 
- Video streams: `YUV`, `RGB`

# Global settings
GaiaViz stores global settings in the global folder


# How GaiaViz stores data: folder structure

GaiaViz stores the data as [[Comma Separated Values formatted]] plain text files in a *datascape*. A datascape is a folder on your local file system, including any subfolders.

Because files are plain text files, you can use other text editors, spreadsheets editor and file managers to edit and manage files.

You can create a datascape anywhere your operating system allows, but we do recommend using our structure to keep things organized.

You can open multiple datascapes as individual windows, or within the same scene, although tags merging is not yet supported.
