## Prerequisite:

- Navigation is pretty straight forward
- GaiaViz operators needs to be familiar with 3D tools and data wrangling process.

The minimum requirements for GaiaViz are:

> Depending on your use-case, the required memory may vary



GaiaViz has a very efficient drawing pipeline and can run on many machines as long as a dedicated GPU is available.
However, due to our effort to develop crisp and ultra-low latency experience, we strongly encourage you to seek performant machines to experience the entiere experience.
